# Cryptic Images: Secure Data Embedding Using Steganography
This project demonstrates how to securely hide and retrieve a secret message in an image using a custom encryption-decryption algorithm. The code utilizes the concept of Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding to embed a message and a passcode into an image. The image is then saved with the hidden data, and the user can retrieve the hidden message by entering the correct passcode.
